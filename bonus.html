        <h1 style="color:red;">Galway Gunston</h1>
<p> Gunston looks somewhat like an overgrown, green shaggy Muppet with a yellow nose, and remarkably unlike anything found in nature.The Patriot, the mascot we know today, arrived in time for the 2009-10 basketball season and has been inspiring Mason spirit for almost a decade</p>

<ol>
    <li>Gunston is named for Gunston Hall Plantation</li>
    <li>Gunston were to be marketed as much as the Patriot is during basketball season</li>
    <li>Some say that he was a bad mascot for Mason</li>
</ol>
